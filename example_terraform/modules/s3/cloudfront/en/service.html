UrMy service requires internet access, a UrMy-enabled device, and you must provide UrMy with one or more payment methods. 'Payment Method' means a currently valid and approved payment method, which may be updated as necessary and may include payment through a third-party account. If the membership is not canceled before the payment date, the membership fee for the next payment cycle will be charged to the member's payment method (see 'Cancellation' below). We may offer a variety of memberships, such as special promotional memberships or memberships provided by third parties in conjunction with the supply of their own products and services. Some memberships have different terms and restrictions, which will be disclosed upon registration or through other communications available to the member.

The membership trial period is specified at the time of registration and is provided for the purpose of allowing new members and some existing members to experience the service. Members may cancel at any time during the trial period, in which case there will be no charge. UrMy will notify members before the trial period ends. If a member does not cancel membership before the end of the trial period, UrMy will charge the membership fee for the next payment cycle to the registered payment method at the end of the trial period. Members can also check the membership fee end date through the 'Membership Confirmation' menu on the 'Account' page inside the app. The provision of the trial period and eligibility to use it are determined at the sole discretion of UrMy. For example, in order to prevent abuse of the trial period, UrMy may limit the qualification for use or the period during which the experience is provided. UrMy reserves the right to withdraw the trial period and suspend the account if it is found that the member is not eligible for the trial period. Members of households who currently have UrMy membership or have recently canceled membership are not eligible for the trial period. UrMy can use information such as device ID, payment method, and email address that you have been using or recently used to determine eligibility for the trial period.
